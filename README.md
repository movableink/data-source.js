# Data Source JS

Data Source is a JS library meant to help developers access Movable Ink Data Sources and the raw responses associated with their API integrations.

## Installation
Add data sources to your package.json file. In `dependencies` include the following:
```
"data-source.js": "https://github.com/movableink/data-source.js.git#v0.0.3"
```

## Usage

### Setup

The client is meant to be ran in a browser-like environment. The package itself is meant to be imported through ES6 modules.

```js
import DataSource from "data-source.js"
```

You will need to transpile your project using a module syntax that is supported in the browser, e.g. CommonJS, AMD

### Fetching data

```html
<script>
  const key = "unique_datasource_key";  // pulled from the data sources application
  const targetingKeys = {
    targeting_1: CD.param('targeting_1'),
    targeting_2: CD.param('targeting_2')
  }; // optional params that will get passed to sorcerer

  const client = new DataSource(key);

  client.getRawData(targetingKeys, function(rawData) {
    // do something with the raw data
  });
</script>
```

The `key` above is supposed to be a unique identifier that refers to the data source that you are trying to receive raw
data from. You can find this key in the Movable Ink platform.

## Changelog

### 0.0.3
  * Remove `src/` as `.npmignore`-ed directory
    * This was originally added to keep the `.ts` files out of the npm package, as people pulling from npm should just use the built `dist/` directory as the entrypoint to the library. Problem is, is that this then keeps `src/` out of the package when users install through the `git` paths. `tsc` fails due to not having any input directories.
    * For now, we can remove this and keep the original `src/` in the package, as most users won't be pulling from `npm`.

### 0.0.2
  * Fix `No inputs were found in config file` by hardcoding `include` path

### 0.0.1
  * Initial release
